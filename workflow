# Assign 5: Version  Workflow 
Questions integrated:

## 1)  How do you download files from a GitHub repository? 
ACCESS CURRENT VERSION:

#### Go to our group 3 repository at https://github.com/Alannao/the-game and access our "Right Room" branch, my assigned Main tunnel1 folder, image subfolder, and/or the tunnel1.html file. 

## 2) How do you move files on your local machine?
WORK ON ENVIRONMENT: 

### A) If I need to work with the whole https://github.com/Alannao/the-game repository, I may download it into my IT 115 subfolder for the repository.  
### Because I use Mac and PC, I will use the appropriate non-terminal tools (Windows Explorer or Mac Finder) to move and access.  Current goal is to get more confident in my terminal management and use that route.  

EDIT TOOLS: 

### A) If downloaded to computer, I use Bracket's or using basic text editor.  Open files in Brackets to work on them.  

### B) If on my Github test repository, I typically use the file edit function to edit the content of the html file and pull requests to update the image folder. However, because I am learning, I test different routes for each. 

## 4) How do you test code locally to verify that it works?
SAVING AND TESTING: 

### A)  Test and retest in both environments before, during and after commits. 
### B)  Save changes on each file and run the Brackets preview feature and/or do a pull request back into my own https://github.com/kbish001/github-page-test testing repository, test and run, to verify functionality.


## 5) How to you merge your changes back to the main project on GitHub?
PULL REQUEST TO INTEGRATE BACK INTO GROUP 3/RIGHT ROOM MAIN:
### To get back into our group directory I do a pull request back into https://github.com/Alannao/the-game/tree/main/tunnel1 for review and acceptance or rejections by other group members.
